# Before Idea (Hypothesis template)

![image](https://andreyazimov.github.io/img/idea.jpg)

I have a lot of ideas during my life but before marked this as an idea I recomend to my self make simple test.
Try to answer this simple questions to figure out is this something that can be real?

1. What is not satisfied need that my client is actively seeking and willing to pay for it. One particular. Not two or more.
2. Who is my client? One particular persona
3. What he is not satisfying him in the existing solutions?
4. Where are the proofs that he is: Actively seeking for the solution and willing to pay for its solutions.
5. Why the client will choose me from all existing solutions? What is my USP (Unique Selling Proposition).
6. Where such client are hangout this big concentration?

And after this it become more clear. Finding answer on this question is the good start and I don't have any excuses about what I should do with my new "Idea"

# More simple was with hypothesis

1. I believe [WHO] has [PROBLEM]

2. I believe [WHO] will [PAY ME FOR WHAT] because [PAINS]

3. I have [SOLUTION] that will solve this problem
